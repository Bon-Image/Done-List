          The “done list,” as shared by Oliver Burkeman, offers a refreshing
          alternative to the usual to-do list. Instead of obsessing over what’s
          next, we pause to acknowledge the things we’ve already achieved—no
          matter how small. This simple practice can help quiet the constant
          pressure of productivity, offering a sense of accomplishment and
          presence. It reminds us that we are enough, and that progress is
          already being made, even when it feels like we’re still behind. Learn
          more about this mindful approach
